## Easy
Given an array, arr[] sorted in ascending order and an integer k. Return true if k is present in the array, otherwise, false.
Examples:
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6], k = 6
Output: true
Exlpanation: Since, 6 is present in the array at index 4 (0-based indexing), output is true.
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 4, 5, 6], k = 3
Output: false
Exlpanation: Since, 3 is not present in the array, output is false.
Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 5, 6], k = 1
Output: false
Constraints:1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 1061 ≤ k ≤ 1061 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 106
