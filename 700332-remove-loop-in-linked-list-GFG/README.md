Given the head of a singly linked list, the task is to remove a cycle if present. A cycle exists when a node's next pointer points back to a previous node, forming a loop. Internally, a variable pos denotes the index of the node where the cycle starts, but it is not passed as a parameter. The terminal will print true if a cycle is removed otherwise, it will print false.
Examples:
Input: head = 1 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 4, pos = 2
Output: true
Explanation: The linked list looks likeA loop is present in the list, and it is removed.

Input: head = 1 -&gt; 8 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 4, pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: The Linked list does not contains any loop. 
Input: head = 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 4, pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: The linked list looks like A loop is present in the list, and it is removed.
Constraints:1 ≤ size of linked list ≤ 105
